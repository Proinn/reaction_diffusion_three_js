# reaction_difussion_three_js
tests of reaction difussions simulations useing WebGL shaders and Three.js

## sources
Inspiration for the reaction diffusion system implemented in this repo is comming from The Coding Train (Daniel Shiffmann) tutorials on Youtub [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV9ny785UNc). 

To get some idea about how to use THREE.js I used some tutorials by Yuri Artyukh that can be found on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/flintyara).
